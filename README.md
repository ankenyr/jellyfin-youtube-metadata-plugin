# Jellyfin Youtube Metadata Plugin

## Overview
Plugin for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) that retrieves metadata
for content from Youtube.

### Features
- Local provider uses the `info.json` files provided from [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or similar programs.
- Remote provider uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download `info.json` files.
- Supports thumbnails of `jpg` or `webp` format for both channel and videos
- Supports the following library types
  - MovieS
  - Music Videos
  - Shows

### Requirements
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is required if you are using the remote provider.

## Installation

### Installing From Repository (Recommended)
1. Go to the `Admin Dashboard`.
1. In the left navigation menu, click on `Plugins`.
1. In the top menu, click `Repositories`.
1. Click the `+` icon to add a new repository.
1. `Repository Name` can be anything.
1. `URL` must be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-plugin-repo/master/manifest.json`
1. If done correctly you should see a new repository on the page.
1. In the top menu, navigate to `Catalog`.
1. Under the `Metadata` section click on `YoutubeMetadata`.
1. Click `Install`.
1. Restart Jellyfin.
1. On the left navigation menu, click on Plugins.
1. If successful, you will see `YoutubeMetadata` with status as `Active`

### Manual Installation (Hard)
1. Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin/releases).
1. Download the latest zip file.
1. Unzip contents into `<jellyfin data directory>/plugins/YoutubeMetadata`.
1. Restart Jellyfin.
1. On the left navigation menu, click on Plugins.
1. If successful, you will see `YoutubeMetadata` with status as `Active`

## Usage
### File Naming Requirements
All media needs to have the ID embeded in the file name within square brackets.
The following are valid examples of a channel and video.
- `3Blue1Brown - NA - 3Blue1Brown_-_Videos [UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw].info.json`
- `3Blue1Brown - 20211023 - A_few_of_the_best_math_explainers_from_this_summer [F3Qixy-r_rQ].mkv`

`info.json` and image files need to have the same file name as the media file. As an example, this would cause a breakage
- `3Blue1Brown - 20211023 - A_few_of_the_best_math_explainers_from_this_summer [F3Qixy-r_rQ].mkv`
- `3Blue1Brown - 20211023 [F3Qixy-r_rQ].info.json`

The proper naming format is the default when using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
and is also enforced in [TheFrenchGhosty's Ultimate YouTube-DL Scripts Collection](https://github.com/TheFrenchGhosty/TheFrenchGhostys-Ultimate-YouTube-DL-Scripts-Collection) which I highly recommend.

### Enabling Provider
1. Navigate to your `Admin Dashboard`.
1. On the left navigation menu, click `Libraries`.
1. Click on ![Threedots](docs/threedots.png) for a supported library type.
1. Click `Manage library`.
1. Click the checkbox next to `YoutubeMetadata` for each downloader or fetcher you wish to enable. In the image below you can see two enabled.
![Library Fetchers](docs/library_fetchers.png)
1. Click `OK`.
1. Click `Scan All Libraries`.

1. Create folder named `YoutubeMetadata` in the `plugins` directory inside your Jellyfin data
   directory. You can find your directory by going to Dashboard, and noticing the Paths section.
   Mine is the root folder of the default Metadata directory.
    ```
    # mkdir <Jellyfin Data Directory>/plugins/YoutubeMetadata/

    ```
1. Place the resulting files from step 3 in the `plugins/YoutubeMetadata` folder created in step 4.

    ```
1. Be sure that the plugin files are owned by your `jellyfin` user:
    ```
    # chown -R jellyfin:jellyfin /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/YoutubeMetadata/
    ```
1. If performed correctly you will see a plugin named YoutubeMetadata in `Admin -> Dashboard ->
   Advanced -> Plugins`.
