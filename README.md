This plugin will download metadata about Youtube videos using a Youtube API key.

## Usage
Currently this plugin only works with the Movie library. Your videos must have the Youtube ID in square braces at the end of the file name. The following are valid names that will be able to be identified.

 - 20110622-Coffee_-_The_Greatest_Addiction_Ever [OTVE5iPMKLg].mp4
 - 20111130-Death_to_Pennies [y5UT04p5f7U].mp4
 - 20120529-Is_Pluto_a_planet [Z_2gbGXzFbs].mp4

Future plans to allow users to specify their own regex is planned.

   Mine is the root folder of the default Metadata directory.

    ```
1. Place the resulting files from step 3 in the `plugins/YoutubeMetadata` folder created in step 4.

    # cp -r bin/*.dll <Jellyfin Data Directory>/plugins/YoutubeMetadata/`
    ```
1. Be sure that the plugin files are owned by your `jellyfin` user:
    ```
    # chown -R jellyfin:jellyfin /var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/YoutubeMetadata/
    ```
1. If performed correctly you will see a plugin named YoutubeMetadata in `Admin -> Dashboard ->
   Advanced -> Plugins`.
